# 🌍 Country Area Predictor

This is a Python-based application that scrapes country data from a public website, stores the information in a MySQL database, trains a decision tree classifier to predict a country's area based on its population, and presents a user-friendly GUI for predictions.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Web scraping of country name, capital, population, and area using `BeautifulSoup`.
- Storage of the cleaned data into a MySQL database.
- Machine Learning model built using `scikit-learn`'s Decision Tree Classifier.
- A simple desktop GUI built with `Tkinter` to predict a country's area based on its population input.

---

## 📦 Dependencies

Make sure you have the following libraries installed:

```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 mysql-connector-python scikit-learn
```

---

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/country-area-predictor.git
cd country-area-predictor
```

2. **Create the MySQL Database:**

Before running the script, you must create a MySQL database and a table named `information`.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE country_info;

USE country_info;

CREATE TABLE information (
  Country VARCHAR(100),
  Capital VARCHAR(100),
  Population INT,
  Area FLOAT
);
```

3. **Update Database Credentials:**

In the script, replace the following values with your actual MySQL credentials:

```python
connection = mysql.connector.connect(
    host="127.0.0.1",
    user="your-username",
    password="your-password",
    database="country_info"
)
```

4. **Run the script:**

```bash
python main.py
```

A Tkinter window will appear allowing you to input a population and predict the area based on the trained decision tree model.

## 🧠 How It Works

- The app scrapes data from [`scrapethissite.com`](https://www.scrapethissite.com/pages/simple/).
- It processes and cleans the data.
- The data is inserted into a MySQL table.
- The model is trained using population as a feature and area as the target.
- The user inputs a population number via GUI to receive a predicted area.

## ✅ To-Do / Improvements

- Add error handling for database and network errors.
- Improve prediction accuracy by using more features (e.g., continent, GDP, etc.).
- Add data caching to avoid re-scraping on every run.
- Refactor into modules (`scraper.py`, `database.py`, `model.py`, `gui.py`) for cleaner architecture.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

> This project was created as a **beginner-level practice**. The dataset contains **only around 200 samples**, which means the predictions made by the machine learning model are **not highly accurate** and should not be used for serious decision-making. The primary goal of this project was to practice web scraping, data processing, ML model training, and GUI creation in Python.
