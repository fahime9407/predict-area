# Area Prediction Project (Practice)

This project is a basic machine learning exercise aimed at predicting area values based on input features. It is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook using Python and popular data science libraries.

> ⚠️ **Note:** The model used in this project does not achieve high accuracy and is intended for practice purposes only.

## 📁 Files Included

- `main.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.
- `requirements.txt`: A list of all required Python libraries to run the notebook.
- `data.csv`: A CSV file with the dataset, in case you're unable to fetch the data from the source.

---

## ⚙️ Installation

To set up the environment and run the notebook:

```bash
# Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate  # on Windows

# Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

Then open the notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook main.ipynb
```
